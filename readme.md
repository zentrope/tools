# tools

Most of these utilities exercise some libs of the Go language
ecosystem or are handy for me in some small way that might just as
well have been a shell script. For instance, the `webdev` server is
great for web applications that use a router library and want to
refresh or bookmark a route under development.

* **bcrypt** <br/> Create and test hashed passwords.

* **bsdpkg** <br/> Create a FreeBSD package from a directory.

* **docker-proxy** <br/> Proxy Docker API web requests to the Docker
  Daemon's unix domain socket.

- **ftree** <br/> Print a date-prefixed directory tree for sorting to
  find most recently changed files.

* **hname** <br/> Print host name.

* **kmake** <br/> Using a config, create a bsd packageable directory.

* **mave** <br/> Unfinished experiment to parse/pull maven deps.

* **sslq** <br/> Query or download SSL certs.

* **uuid** <br/> Print out one or more randomly generated UUIDs.

* **webdev** <br/> Serve a directory as a website, if 404, reload
  index.html (good for react-router or similar).

The newer tools have documentation in their readme files.
