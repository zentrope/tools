# log â†’ rip

Read various log file formats and attempt to parse them into a
cannonical or generic data representation something else might
leverage.

## Dev testing with included data

The data stored in `~/data` is compressed, so uncompress it and pipe
it through the filter to see what happens.

    $ cat /var/log/system.log | go run main.go

Use something like this when developing new grammars.

## To do

* A command-line parameter to indicate which grammar file to use.

* Define a grammar for a web log.

* Figure out how the grammer should add interpolated values (such as
  year) if it's not already available in the log.

* Add a map of field names to canonical representation to the grammar
  file so that we can programmatically pull out the correct parse
  results to fill in the normalized log fact record.

* Add a mechanism to cache compiled regular expresssions so they're
  not re-compiled per line.

* Maybe embed grammar files in the produced binary? Either that, or a
  parameter to point to a data repo location.
